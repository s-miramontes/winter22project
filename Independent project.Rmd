## Defining variables

First lets define 'independent' variables that are drawn from a distribution rather than from the model.\  
In this particular case, these variables are the ones that, given our DAG, do not have arrows coming into them (i.e. those variables that are not influenced by the model).\  



```{r}
set.seed(62)
n=5000
age = round(rnorm(n, mean =50, sd = 13),1)
immigrant = rbinom(n, 1, .15)
race = sample(c(rep('white',times = n *.7),rep('black', times = n*.2), rep('other',times=n*.1)))
```

Of note we established that, most likely the immigrant variable would be influenced by the ethnicity variable. And we can figure out a way to draw samples given ethnicity. However, for the first part of the exmample and for simplicity we will just create a binomial variable for immigrant.\  

## The model 

Given the following DAG we established our data generation rule using an example f how Maria would create these data on STATA:

`generate mean_education = 12 - .1*age +2.5(age<50) * immigrant + (age>=50*immigrant) - black*immigrant - 1.5*other`

Now, the way I 'relaxed' the problem was to brake down each one of the variables and then putting them back on to the model so it can be translated to other software languages.

```{r}
x0 = 12

x1 = -.1*age

#I am not 100% sure about these but the syntax says: 
#If a person is younger than 50, multiply 2.5*immigrant status, else assign 0 (i.e. This coefficient doesn't count)
x2 = ifelse(age<50,2.5*immigrant,0) 

#If a person is 50 or older, just use immigrant status, else assign 0 (i.e. This coefficient doesn't count)                                    
x3 = ifelse(age>=50, immigrant, 0)  

#If a person's race is black assign a -1 else assign 0 (i.e. This coefficient doesn't count)     
x4 = ifelse(race=="black",-1,0)

#If a person's race is other assign a -1.5 else assign 0 (i.e. This coefficient doesn't count)    
x5 = ifelse(race=="other",-1.5,0)


mean_education = mean_education = x0 + x1 + x2 +x3 + x4 + x5

```


Alernaively we can code it as:

```{R}
mean_educ2 = 12 - (.1*age) + (age<50)*2.5*immigrant - (age>=50)*immigrant - 1*(race=='black') - 1.5*(race=="other")
```

Now we asssign a random term to education and combine it with the mean education

```{r}
random_education = rnorm(n)*3

education = mean_education + random_education
```


Since we established a rule for age where there is a cutoff we need to create a variable that reflects this cutoff (i.e making age binary)

```{r}
bin_age = as.numeric(age < 50)
```

To make easy reading the code we can put all these on a data frame

```{r}
data = data.frame(age,
                  immigrant,
                  race,
                  mean_education,
                  mean_educ2,
                  education,
                  bin_age,
                  x0,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5)
```
\  
\  


   Here we see tha both ways of coding mean education give the same answer

```{r}
head(data,20)
```



Let's check the model!

```{r}

model_1 = lm(education ~age + immigrant + as.factor(race) + (bin_age*immigrant))

summary(model_1)
```
